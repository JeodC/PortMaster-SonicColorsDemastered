## Installation
Download the game from itch.io: https://randomocity-gaming.itch.io/sonic-colors-demastered and unzip the files to `ports/soniccolorsdemastered/assets`.

## Notes
This port demands high performance and is tagged for "power". It runs well on the Retroid Pocket Mini and Retroid Pocket 5, but other devices are untested.
